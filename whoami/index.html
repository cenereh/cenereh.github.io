            <p>So I guess an introduction is in order here.</p>
<p>Hello, my name is cinder, otherwise know as &quot;cenereh&quot; on GitHub. I just turned 21 (<em>yes i am getting old</em>) and I have decided to start my own blog!
I've made cybersecurity research my passion a long time ago, probably around secondary school. At the moment, I am a SOC analyst, working as a blue team operator.
My main research field is the Windows kernel, its internals and anything that runs at ring 0. I'm mostly interested in AV/EDR solutions and I am currently trying to further refine my skills as a security analyst.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><h2 id="the-goal-of-this-blog">The goal of this blog:</h2>
<p>I often work on personal projects and I have decided to stop keeping them for myself anymore. I will start documenting some of them on this blog, in order to keep track of my progress and what I learn while working on them. By sharing my knowledge, I hope to inspire other people as well to pursue my same career path. It is also beneficial for my career to keep a blogpost with my work documentation, as it provides a deep insight to potential recruiters into my line of work.</p>
<p>I will sometimes post writeups which won't be cybersecurity related. This is to provide some variety and character to my blogpost, and to talk about something else sometimes. Some blogposts feel like too &quot;robotic&quot; to me, hopefully I will bring some character to mine :)</p>
<p>And if I ever forget something that I previously did (which happens very often), having a blogpost with everything documented will help me clear up my memory.</p>
<h2 id="more-about-me">More about me:</h2>
<p>I got for the first time into cybersecurity when I was 7, when I made my very first &quot;malware&quot; using Visual Basic scripting. It wasn't actual malware, but a simple error text box which said &quot;you have opened a virus&quot; or something like that. A harmless prank that I did make on my dad and my sister. My dad, which is a retired software engineer, knew what &quot;openme.vbs&quot; was, and I think that I made him really proud. My sister got scared shitless, to mine and my father's amusement. That was my very first contact with the world of Cybsersecurity.</p>
<p>I started getting interested in low-level programming when I got into cheat development at the age of 14. I never made anything spectacular at the time, but I did put lots of effort into learning how to reverse engineer software and how to code in C and x86 Assembly. I also got further into malware development when I was 18, learning Windows internal mechanisms from the Windows Internals book and a tiny bit of kernel programming.</p>
<p>Right now I am working as an analyst in a SOC with multiple EDR technologies. I am working on starting my own cybersecurity company as well, but I'll talk about it when the appropriate time comes, I can't share lots of details right now as I prefer to touch that subject when the company will actually exist.</p>
<p>I am still as enthusiastic as I was back then about anything low-level, albeit with less time at my disposal. My work takes a lot of my time, but whenever I have the chance I always like to read up research on anything low-level and to work on my own projects as well.</p>
<p>I do watch football (or &quot;soccer&quot; for my american readers), I have Inter Milan close to my heart and I do follow them a lot. I am a big Nintendo fan, proven by the fact that I own two Nintendo Switches, one of them is modded with a Picofly modchip. I grew up with Pokemon since I was 6, so I consider that franchise to be my favourite, even if lately Game Freak is not publishing good Pokemon games.</p>
<p>I'd say you know enough about me, so I'll move on with the next chapter.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-to-come">What's to come?</h2>
<p>I'd like to dedicate this blog to my projects: documenting and explaining the thought process behind them, with some cybersecurity unrelated posts here and there. 
My next posts will be dedicated to creating a x64 EFI bootkit with spoofing capabilities. Next in line, I will probably talk and review Binary Ninja and Sidekick.</p>
<p>I'm still figuring out the best way to sign off my blog posts, just as with my emails. In the meantime, stay tuned for more content!</p>
<p>Welcome to the club!</p>
